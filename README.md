Overview
This project models two scenarios:

Solved Problem: Finding the shortest path in a static road network using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
Example: Delhi → Jaipur → Mumbai.
Unsolved Problem: Optimizing large-scale, dynamic road networks with real-time updates.
Explores research areas like Graph Neural Networks and Quantum Computing.

Features
Interactive Graph Visualization:
Simulates Dijkstra’s Algorithm step-by-step.
Nodes and edges are animated for clarity.
Real-Time Dynamic Network Placeholder:
A visual mock-up of real-time data integration.
Responsive Design:
Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
Back to Top Button:
Smooth scrolling for improved navigation.



Technologies Used
HTML5: Structure of the website.
CSS3: Styling, animations, and responsive design.
JavaScript: Graph logic, interactivity, and animations.


Usage
Simulate Shortest Path:
Click the Simulate Dijkstra’s Algorithm button in the Solved Problem section.
Watch the graph animate as it finds the shortest path.
Explore Dynamic Networks:
Observe the placeholder animation for real-time updates in the Unsolved Problem section.
